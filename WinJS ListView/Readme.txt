## Steps to Recreate:

1. Launch sample on a touch-based machine
2. Scroll around and touch some tiles (make sure you use touch input -- the problem doesn't manifest using a mouse)
3. Observe the timestamp at the bottom update with every tile touch

Expected result: the timestamp always updates, no matter how much you scroll around

Actual result: at some point, the timestamp stops updating and won't register any more tile touches

Platforms Affected: Windows 1803 and above, on HP tablet and Microsoft Surface Pro

Platforms Not Affected: Windows 1703, on HP tablet and Microsoft Surface Pro
